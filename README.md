# ELIZA Slackbot
This is a more advanced example for building a slackbot.

For some basic functionality it relies on a [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA])
implementation [in Go](https://github.com/necrophonic/go-eliza).

## How to get started with it?
- `go build`
- Configure your bot integration in slack and get your token.
- Export your token: `export SLACK_TOKEN=<your slack token>`
- `./eliza-slackbot`

Have fun.
